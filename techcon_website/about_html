                HISTORY OF TECHON 2024
            </h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began as a visionary idea — a grassroots initiative born out of the need to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and practical, real-world applications. First conceptualized in 2021 by a collective of tech enthusiasts, educators, and startup founders, the conference was envisioned as a hub where innovation meets collaboration.The inaugural TechCon was held in 2022 as a modest, single-day meetup focused on software development, blockchain, and digital entrepreneurship. Despite its small scale, the impact was significant. It brought together over 200 participants, including students, tech professionals, and investors, all eager to connect and learn.
                Building on that momentum, TechCon evolved rapidly. By 2023, it expanded to a 3-day event with a wider scope, featuring tracks on AI, Web3, cybersecurity, robotics, and green technology. The conference also introduced interactive workshops, live hackathons, and pitch sessions, establishing itself as a launchpad for startups and a recruiting ground for tech companies.
                Now, in TechCon 2024, the event has matured into one of the most anticipated tech conferences in the region. It celebrates not just the advancement of technology, but also its human-centered design and potential for social impact. This year’s theme — "Tech for a Resilient Future" — reflects the urgent need for sustainable innovation, digital inclusion, and resilient systems in a rapidly changing world.
